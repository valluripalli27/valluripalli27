👋 Hi, I’m @valluripalli27
👀 I am a UI/UX Designer and Frontend Developer with a strong focus on crafting intuitive, accessible, and visually engaging digital experiences. I specialize in end-to-end website design—from wireframes and prototypes to fully functional, responsive websites—using tools like Figma, Adobe XD, Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, and Canva. I also have expertise in WordPress, Elementor, and other CMS platforms, enabling me to design and build sites that are both visually compelling and performance-optimized.
Beyond design, I bring data analytics and visualization skills with SQL, R, Tableau, Power BI, allowing me to create data-driven dashboards and reports that inform design decisions and enhance user engagement. I thrive on transforming complex ideas into seamless, high-performing interfaces that balance creativity with functionality.
🌱 I’m currently advancing my React.js expertise to build dynamic, reusable components and exploring automation in CMS and BI tools to streamline workflows, enhance content delivery, and improve analytics accessibility.
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on innovative projects that combine UI/UX design, frontend development, CMS customization, and data visualization—whether it’s creating engaging websites, designing interactive dashboards, or developing scalable, user-focused solutions.
📫 How to reach me: Feel free to contact me via email at lakshmiprasannavlu@gmail.com  or connect with me on LinkedIn - www.linkedin.com/in/lakshmi-prasanna-8b3010160. I’m always open to networking and collaboration opportunities!

⚡ Fun fact: Outside of work, I enjoy working on personal projects that combine my love for technology and design. I’m also passionate about exploring new tools and technologies that can enhance the way we interact with digital products.
